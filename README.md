# Introduction 
Hobby project for solving the Poisson equation efficiently.
The plan is to have a maintainable, expandable code base that can be integrated into a GUI and serve as educational tool.
This is, however, only the secondary goal. The primary goal is to refresh my Python knowledge and my knowledge of Programming
tools and workflows in general to make me employable.

# Fundamentals 
As a first step, we simply solve the Poisson equation in homogeneous media.
In electrostatics, we can write the electric field as the gradient of a potential.
Then the Poisson equation just follows from Maxwell's equations
